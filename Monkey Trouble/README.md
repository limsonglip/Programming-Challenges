I have two monkeys, a and b, and the parameters a_smile and b_smile indicate if each is smiling.

I am in trouble if they are both smiling or if neither of them is smiling.

Return True if I am in trouble.

The algorithm should output these results:
- monkey_trouble(True, True) → True
- monkey_trouble(False, False) → True
- monkey_trouble(True, False) → False
